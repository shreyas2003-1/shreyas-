Project Overview
The project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Goibibo Airlines dataset, focusing on domestic flight operations in India. It involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and analysis of various factors affecting flight prices and performance.

Key Steps Performed:
Data Loading and Cleaning:

The dataset was loaded, and initial checks for shape, data types, and descriptive statistics were performed.
Unwanted columns were removed.
The price column was cleaned and converted to numeric format.
Date columns were parsed to datetime format.
Handling Missing and Duplicate Data:

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Duplicate records were identified and removed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analysis of top-performing airlines.
Visualization of the most booked seat classes by customers.
Analysis of flight stop counts (e.g., non-stop, 1-stop).
Price distribution analysis and key statistics on flight prices.
Price Analysis:

Average price analysis by airline, seat class, stop count, and departure location.
Histograms and pie charts were used for visual insights.

# Goibibo Airlines EDA Project

## Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis of the Goibibo Airlines dataset, focusing on domestic flight operations in India. The analysis aims to uncover key insights about airline performance, pricing trends, and customer preferences.

## Dataset
The dataset contains **300,261 flight records** with the following key columns:
- `flight date`: Date of the flight
- `airline`: Name of the airline
- `class`: Seat class (e.g., Economy, Business)
- `price`: Price of the flight ticket
- `stops`: Number of stops (e.g., non-stop, 1-stop)
- `from`, `to`: Departure and destination locations

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed unwanted columns and handled missing values.
   - Converted date columns to datetime format and cleaned the `price` column.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed top airlines by number of flights.
   - Explored customer preferences for seat classes and stop counts.
   - Visualized price distribution and calculated average prices by various categories.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Bar charts and pie charts for airline performance and seat class preferences.
   - Histograms for price distribution.
   - Grouped analysis for average pricing based on airline, seat class, and flight stops.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Insights
- Certain airlines showed consistently higher performance in terms of flight bookings.
- The most booked seat class was identified, providing insights into customer preferences.
- The analysis of stop counts helped identify popular flight types (e.g., non-stop).
- Pricing analysis revealed the average ticket prices across different categories.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the domestic flight market of Goibibo Airlines, which can be used for pricing strategy, customer segmentation, and improving overall airline performance.
